# Biblio Configuration Example
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to `config.yaml`
# 2. Update the library_path to point to your Calibre libraries directory. 
#    If using Docker, synchronize with the compose.yaml volumes definition.
# 3. Adjust other settings as needed for your environment
# 4. Restart the application

# Path to the Calibre libraries directory
# Examples:
#   Linux/Mac: "/home/username/calibre-libraries"
#   Windows: "C:\\Users\\username\\calibre-libraries"
#
# For Docker, if compose.yaml contains the following lines:
#   volumes:
#     # Mount the Calibre libraries directory
#     - /path/to/your/calibre-libraries:/calibre-libraries:rw
# Use the following for library_path: /calibre-libraries
library_path: "/path/to/your/calibre-libraries"

# IP and port for the Biblio server to bind to.
# For Docker, ensure this is in line with definitions in the 
# compose.yaml and Dockerfile.
# Format: "IP:PORT"
# Examples:
#   "0.0.0.0:8080" - Listen on all interfaces, port 8080
#   "127.0.0.1:3000" - Listen only on localhost, port 3000
service_ip_and_port: "0.0.0.0:8080"

# Path to the users.ids file containing user credentials
# Format: username:password_hash (one per line)
# Each user should have a corresponding entry with hashed password
users_file_path: "users.ids"

# HTTPS/TLS Configuration
#
# To enable HTTPS:
# 1. Set use_https to true
# 2. Generate or obtain SSL/TLS certificates
# 3. Update certificate_path and private_key_path with file locations
# 4. Rebuild and restart the application
#
# CERTIFICATE GENERATION METHODS:
#
# A. Self-Signed Certificate (for development/testing):
#    mkdir -p certs
#    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
#
# B. Let's Encrypt (for production):
#    Use Certbot to obtain free certificates:
#    certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
#    Update certificate_path and private_key_path to point to:
#    /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem and privkey.pem
#
# C. Self-Signed with Specific Properties:
#    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem \
#    -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
use_https: false

# Path to the SSL/TLS certificate file (PEM format)
# Must be a valid X.509 certificate in PEM format
certificate_path: "certs/cert.pem"

# Path to the SSL/TLS private key file (PEM format)
# Must be the private key corresponding to the certificate above
private_key_path: "certs/key.pem"

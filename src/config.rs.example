/// Configuration module for Biblio
/// 
/// SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
/// 1. Copy this file to `config.rs`
/// 2. Update the LIBRARY_PATH to point to your Calibre libraries directory. 
///    If using Docker, synchronize with the compose.yaml volumes definition.

/// Path to the Calibre libraries directory
/// Example: "/home/username/calibre-libraries" (Linux/Mac)
///          "C:\\Users\\username\\calibre-libraries" (Windows)
///
/// For Docker, if compose.yaml contains the following lines:
///    volumes:
///      # Mount the Calibre libraries directory
///      - /path/to/your/calibre-libraries:/calibre-libraries:rw
/// Use the following for LIBRARY_PATH: /calibre-libraries

/// For Docker, insure that this is in line with definitions in the 
/// compose.yaml and Dockerfile.

/// HTTPS/TLS Configuration
/// 
/// To enable HTTPS:
/// 1. Set USE_HTTPS to true
/// 2. Generate or obtain SSL/TLS certificates
/// 3. Update CERTIFICATE_PATH and PRIVATE_KEY_PATH with file locations
/// 4. Rebuild and restart the application
///
/// CERTIFICATE GENERATION METHODS:
///
/// A. Self-Signed Certificate (for development/testing):
///    mkdir -p certs
///    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
///
/// B. Let's Encrypt (for production):
///    Use Certbot to obtain free certificates:
///    certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
///    Update paths to /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/
///
/// C. Self-Signed with Specific Properties:
///    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem \
///    -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"

pub const USE_HTTPS: bool = false;

/// Path to the SSL/TLS certificate file (PEM format)
/// Must be a valid X.509 certificate in PEM format

/// Path to the SSL/TLS private key file (PEM format)
/// Must be the private key corresponding to the certificate above
